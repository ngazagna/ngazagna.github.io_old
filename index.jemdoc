I am a research scientist at Sony AI in the Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning team lead by [https://sites.google.com/view/lingjuan-lyu/home Lingjuan Lyu].

My topics of research broadly encompass Optimization methods (especially stochastic and federated ones) for Machine Learning problems and more recently AI Privacy.\n

I did my PhD in the [https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal Image, Data, Signal] department at [https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home Télécom Paris] in France.
I worked on stochastic variance-reduced gradient and randomized iterative methods under the supervision of [https://gowerrobert.github.io/ Robert M. Gower] and [http://www.josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon].
More specifically, I was interested in extending /sketch-and-project/ and /splitting/ methods to large scale settings especially by analyzing mini-batch updates and by combining them with existing acceleration techniques (momentum/heavy-ball, Nesterov acceleration, etc.).
I also tried to establish links between existing stochastic optimization methods and reinterpret their updates.\n

As far as possible, I try to code efficient and reproducible experiments through tested open source codes.
I am contributing to the Python open source package [https://github.com/facebookresearch/RidgeSketch RidgeSketch] (developed with FAIR New York) about sketch-and-project methods for the ridge regression problem.
I also contributed to the Julia suite of stochastic optimization codes [https://github.com/gowerrobert/StochOpt.jl StochOpt].\n\n

/Advertisement/ : I highly recommend the [https://github.com/benchopt/benchOpt BenchOpt] Python package which aims at facilitating the benchmark of optimization methods for ML problems.
I will try to contribute more to this package in the future.
